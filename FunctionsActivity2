// Write a JavaScript function to calculate the factorial of a number (a non-negative integer n ). The function accepts the number as an argument.

// create function where n represents the number to be factorised
function factorial(n) {
    
  if (n < 0){ // condition to check if number is non-negative
        return "Only positive number accepted"; // if negative, it will be rejected
      
  } else if (n == 0) // if equal to 0, result is 1
      return (1);
      
 else { //if other number, function will go on with formula which will hits all the integers from 1 to that number and stops
      return (n * factorial(n - 1)); // the function will exit with total value
 }
}
factorial(6);

// Note:
// The factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number and it is represented by n!

// For example, the factorial of 6! is 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720. 

// The factorial is not defined for negative numbers, and the factorial of zero is one, 0! = 1.
