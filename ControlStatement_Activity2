/* Write a JavaScript program that accepts three numbers from the user and prints "Increasing order" if the numbers are in the increasing order, "Decreasing order" if the numbers are in the decreasing order, and "Neither increasing or decreasing order" otherwise.
Test Data:
Input first number: 1524
Input second number: 2345
Input third number: 3321
Expected Output :
Increasing order.
