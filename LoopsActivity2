//  Write a JavaScript program to create the multiplication table (from 1 to 10) of a number.
// prompt to ask user to enter a number and convert a numeric string into number

let number = parseInt(prompt ("Enter a number: "));
//initialise the variable, stopping loop when reaching 10
const n = 10; 

//looping from i = 1 to n

for (let i = 1 ; i <= n; i++ ) { // in each iteration, i is increased by 1
  
   let product = number * i; // multiplication to run with the loop
 
 console.log(number + ' x ' + i + ' = ' + product);
}

// Expected Output:

// Input a number: 6

// 6 x 1 = 6 to 6 x 10 = 60
