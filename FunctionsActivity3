// Note: 

// Prime numbers are the numbers that are only divisible by themselves and 1, in other words, if we try to divide them by another number, the result is not a whole number. 

// So, if we divide the number by anything other than 1 or itself, we will get a remainder that is not zero. 

// Negative numbers can not be prime.
