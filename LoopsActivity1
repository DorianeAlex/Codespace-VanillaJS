// Write a JavaScript program that will iterate from 0 to 15. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is odd or even, and display a message to the screen.

// program to display numbers from 0 to 15
// initialise the variable
let i= 0;
const n = 15;

// while loop from i = 1 to 15
//check if the current number is odd or even
while (i <= n) {

 if (i%2 === 0) { //message will be display if number can be divided by 2 and have a remainder of 0 which means it is even
 console.log( i  + " is even");
 } else {
 console.log( i  + " is odd"); // if no even, message will be display to indicate it is an odd number-if number can't be divided by 2 and does not have a remainder of 0
}
i++; // increment the number by one after the while loop is run and stops when reaching 15
}
 
// Expected Output:

// "0 is even"
// "1 is odd"
// "2 is even"
